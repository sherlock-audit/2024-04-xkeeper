# Keep3r Bonded Relay

The `Keep3rBondedRelay` contract efficiently manages executions originating from the Keep3r network when the job is bonded. This contract introduces bonding requirements for automation vaults, ensuring task executions are performed by legitimate bonded keepers.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Bonding Requirements**: The contract introduces flexible bonding requirements for automation vaults. Vault owners can set specific bonding parameters, such as the required bond, minimum bond, earned rewards, and age, ensuring customizable security measures.

- **Bonding Requirement Configuration**: Through the `setAutomationVaultRequirements` function, automation vault owners can dynamically configure bonding requirements. This feature grants control over the security measures necessary for task execution.

- **Task Execution with Bonded Keepers**: The contract efficiently executes tasks with bonded keepers, validating their bonding status based on the configured requirements. This ensures that only legitimate bonded keepers can initiate and complete tasks.

- **Event Emission**: Upon successful execution, the contract emits the `AutomationVaultExecuted` event. This event provides transparency into executed tasks, including details on the associated automation vault and the executed data.

## Keep3r Network

The `Keep3rBondedRelay` contract introduces a novel approach by incorporating dynamic bonding requirements for automation vaults. This design enhances security and control, allowing vault owners to customize bonding parameters and ensuring task executions are carried out by validated bonded keepers.
