# Core Contracts

The core contracts of the xKeeper project are the backbone of the framework. They can be used to generate new vaults, manage balances and approve and revoke permissions for callers and relays.

## Core Contracts

- The [`AutomationVault`](./automation_vault.md) contract manages on-chain job execution with relays, streamlining payment and serving as a core component in user-friendly on-chain automation.

- The [`AutomationVaultFactory`](./automation_vault_factory..md) contract is responsible for deploying new instances of automation vaults.

For more detailed information about each contract, please refer to the respective documentation pages.

For more technical details about the interfaces of the core contracts, please refer to the `Interfaces` section in the technical documentation.
